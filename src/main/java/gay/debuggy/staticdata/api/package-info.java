/**
 * This package contains classes that API users are permitted and encouraged to use.
 * 
 * <p>The items in this package are the ones subject to a SemVer-like standard:
 * 
 * <ul>
 *   <li>From patch version to patch version, bugfixes can be made, and small features may be added, but nothing removed
 *   <li>Significant new features will trigger a minor version, but again, nothing will be removed
 *   <li>Major versions indicate breaking changes. Expect to have to rewrite some code to migrate to a new major version.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>This means you can rely on staticdata with versions like "1.+" or "1.0.+", depending on your comfort level, but never
 * "1+"
 *
